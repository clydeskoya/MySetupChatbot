Oxygen 25 
Top Panel 
Octave/Wheels 
1. PITCH: 
This 
wheel 
creates 
expressive 
changes 
in 
performances by raising and lowering pitch.  
Rolling the Pitch Bend wheel upward will raise an instrument’s 
pitch whereas rolling it downward will lower the pitch.  
The upper and lower pitch bend limit is determined by settings 
on your hardware or software synthesizer, not by the Pitch 
Bend wheel on the Oxygen 25 keyboard itself. Typically, this 
can be either a half note or an octave up/down.  
This wheel is spring mounted and will return to the center 
detent position when released.  
2. MOD (Modulation): This wheel is used to add expression to 
performances by changing the intensity of certain effects.  
By default, most synthesizers assign this wheel to control 
vibrato (change in intonation) or tremolo (change in volume) 
although it is usually possible to reassign the function of this 
wheel through the instrument’s control panel.  
Rolling the Modulation Wheel upward will increase the modulation effect, while rolling downward 
will reduce the effect.  
The Modulation Wheel is an assignable controller capable of sending a variety of MIDI messages 
other than Modulation data.  
3. OCTAVE - / +: The Octave buttons are used to shift the keyboard’s octave range up or down in

Octave/Wheels 
1. PITCH: This wheel creates expressive changes in performances by 
raising and lowering pitch. 
Rolling the Pitch Bend wheel upward will raise an instrument’s pitch 
whereas rolling it downward will lower the pitch.  
The upper and lower pitch bend limit is determined by settings on 
your hardware or software synthesizer, not by the Pitch Bend wheel 
on the Oxygen 61 keyboard itself. Typically, this can be either a half 
note or an octave up/down.  
This wheel is spring mounted and will return to the center detent 
position when released.  
2. MOD (Modulation): This wheel is used to add expression to 
performances by changing the intensity of certain effects.  
By default, most synthesizers assign this wheel to control vibrato 
(change in intonation) or tremolo (change in volume) although it is 
usually possible to reassign the function of this wheel through the 
instrument’s control panel.  
Rolling the Modulation Wheel upward will increase the modulation effect, while rolling downward 
will reduce the effect.  
The Modulation Wheel is an assignable controller capable of sending a variety of MIDI messages 
other than Modulation data.  
3. OCTAVE - / +: The Octave buttons are used to shift the keyboard’s octave range up or down in 
one octave increments, extending the octave range of the pads or keys. 
TRANSPOSE: Hold SHIFT and press either of these buttons to transpose the keyboard up or 
down. 
17 
4. Keybed: The velocity-sensitive keyboard is not only the primary method of sending Note On/Off 
and velocity data when performing. It is also used to access extended programing functions 
listed along its upper edge.  
Hold SHIFT and press a labeled key to access these additional programming functions: 
Note: The Key modifiers are dependent on what mode is currently active. For example, if Smart 
Chord mode is active, the only Shift modifier functions will be available for the Smart Chord 
functionality.

DAW Knob Control  
Using the SHIFT button and Pads 9-12 (on the 25-key), or 9-11 (on the 49-key and 61-key) 
will enable you to change the function of knobs in DAW mode.  
DAW Mode 
• 
Volume: Will change the knobs function to control the channel faders in your DAW. 
• 
Pan: Will change the knobs function to control the channel pan knobs in your DAW. 
• 
Device: Will change the knobs function to control the currently selected channel’s plugin 
controls in your DAW.  
Note: Not all DAWs support Device control. 
• 
Sends: Will change the knobs function to control the currently selected channel’s send 
controls in your DAW.  
Note: Not all DAWs support Sends control. 
Channel Selection 
This selects the MIDI channel that will be used to send MIDI messages from the keys, pads, 
knobs, faders, and buttons. 
The last selected control will be the one selected for editing. For example, if the keys are 
pressed before pressing Shift Button and the Channel key are pressed, then the keybed’s 
channel will be selected for editing.

Velocity Curve 
The Velocity Curve selects the velocity curve that the keyboard or drum pads will use for each 
MIDI note. There are 4 different velocity curve settings, and 3 fixed dettings. The 4 velocity 
curve settings are Low, Medium, High, and Linear. The 3 fixed velocity settings give velocities 
of 64, 100, and 127, respectively. 
The last selected control will be the one selected for editing. For example, if the keys are 
pressed before pressing Shift Button and the Velocity key are pressed, then the keybed’s 
velocity curve will be selected for editing. 
If the Velocity Curve function is selected for the drum pads, all drum pads will begin flashing to 
show their Velocity is being edited. 
As Velocity Curves are selected, the LED Display will show the curve in the format as listed 
above.   
Performance Mode will resume after 2 seconds of a value being selected.
