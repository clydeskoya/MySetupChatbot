Main Features
The RC-505 is a live performance tool that lets you record your vocal or guitar performance and then play it back instantly. 
You can maximize your live performance potential by layering sounds in real time.
• Combine five loop tracks for a variety of expressive possibilities.
• Input FX are provided for recording, letting you use effects such as robot voice or vocoder to make your phrase loops 
even more diverse.
• Track FX are provided for the playback tracks, letting you enhance and develop your live performances by applying 
effects that simulate changing the rotational speed of a turntable or the “stuttering” created by repeated notes on a 
sampler.
• Combine previously-recorded phrase loops with realtime recording to make your performances even more exciting. You 
can also import WAV files from your computer to use as phrase loops.
• Use the RC-505 in conjunction with other MIDI equipment for an even broader range of live performance possibilities.

What are tracks 1–5 (p. 12) and phrase memories (p. 15)?
The RC-505 provides five “tracks” that are used to record and play back the sound of an instrument or a microphone.
These five tracks combined form what is called a “phrase memory.” Up to 99 phrase memories can be stored.
“Tracks 1–5,” “Rhythm,” “Input FX,” and “Track FX” settings are saved individually for each phrase memory.
What is a rhythm? (p. 19)
In addition to the five tracks, the RC-505 can also play a “Rhythm.” You can record while listening to a rhythm at the tempo you 
specify.
What is the Input FX and Track FX? (p. 20)
You can apply effects to the audio input and to the sound of the tracks, respectively.
These effects are referred to as “Input FX” and “Track FX.”
What are system settings? (p. 22)
Settings that apply to the entire RC-505, such as those for the contrast of the display, the auto off function, the USB, and MIDI 
functions, are called “system settings.”
Overview of the RC-505
“Recording” versus “Overdub”
In this manual, we refer to the act of recording to an empty track for the first time as “recording.” Any subsequent recordings that are made, 
which are added on top of the existing recording, we refer to as “overdub.”

Turning On the Power
Once everything is properly connected (p. 6), be sure to follow the procedure below to turn on their power. If you turn on equipment in the wrong 
order, you risk causing malfunction or equipment failure.
When powering up
Turn on the power to your amp last.
When powering down
Turn off the power to your amp first.
1.	 Turn the [POWER] switch ON.
Caution when turning on the power
* This unit is equipped with a protection circuit. A brief interval (a few seconds) after turning the unit on is required before it will operate normally. 
* Before turning the unit on/off, always be sure to turn the volume down. Even with the volume turned down, you might hear some sound when 
switching the unit on/off. However, this is normal and does not indicate a malfunction.
Caution when turning off the power
While the RC-505 is in the following states, you must never turn off the power. Doing so may cause all the saved data to be lost.
• While recording/overdub/playing back
• While undoing/redoing
• While switching between phrase memories
• While the following messages are displayed
“Now working..”
, “Now writing...”
, “Now copying..”
, “Exchanging..”
, “Initializing...”
Caution when connecting
* To prevent malfunction and equipment failure, always turn down the volume, and turn off all the units before making any connections.
* Before connecting or disconnecting any connection cables, be sure all the volume controls in your system are set to minimum.
* When connection cables with resistors are used, the volume level of equipment connected to the inputs (AUX/INST jacks) may be low. If this 
happens, use connection cables that do not contain resistors.
Caution when using a microphone
* Howling could be produced depending on the location of microphones relative to speakers. This can be remedied by:
• Changing the orientation of the microphone(s). 
• Relocating microphone(s) at a greater distance from speakers.
• Lowering volume levels.
* If the speakers and microphone are close together, the sound played back from the speakers may be picked up by the microphone. If you record 
or overdub in such a state, the speakers playback picked up by the microphone will also be recorded. You should separate the speakers and 
microphone so that the playback from the speakers is not picked up by the microphone.
Secure the power cord
On the bottom of the RC-505 there is a slot (cord hook) for securing the power cord of the 
AC adapter. 
To prevent the inadvertent disruption of power to your unit (should the plug be pulled out 
accidentally), and to avoid applying undue stress to the DC IN jack, anchor the power cord 
using the cord hook, as shown in the illustration.

Example of Actual Loop Recording
Let’s try loop-recording the following simple 8-beat phrase of vocal percussion (using your voice to imitate the sounds of a drum set) via a 
microphone.
Bass drum 
“Dun!”
Snare drum 
“Pah!”
Hi-hat 
“Chi!”
Preparations
1.	 Connect your microphone, and adjust the input level (“Adjusting the Input Level” (p. 6)).
2.	 Turn the [MEMORY/VALUE] knob to select an empty phrase memory (the [EDIT] buttons of all tracks are unlit).

Record while listening to the rhythm sound
In addition to its five tracks, the RC-505 can sound a “rhythm.” By recording while you listen to a rhythm at the tempo 
you’ve specified, you can record at an accurate tempo. For details, refer to “Rhythm Settings” (p. 19).
Available tracks for recording/overdub
Recording/overdub can be performed on only one track at a time.
For example, if all tracks in the phrase memory are empty, and you’re recording track 1, pressing the track 2 [

Playback starting location
If you turn Loop Sync on, the beginning of the tracks will always be aligned. This means that if tracks are already 
playing back, the playback start location of the other tracks will become “the current location of the phrase being 
played.” The following illustration is an example of how playback will occur with three tracks that contain the 
identical melody but have different loop sync settings.

Synchronizing the Tempo of the Tracks (Tempo Sync)
Each track saves the tempo at which that track was recorded. This is called the “original tempo” of the track. The

Normally, you should leave Tempo Sync on, so all tracks will play at the same tempo (the phrase memory tempo). 
If you turn Tempo Sync off for tracks for which you don’t want the tempo to change (such as those with special

About original tempo
Each track saves the tempo at which that track was recorded. This is called the “original tempo” of the track. The phrase memory also has a 
“phrase memory tempo” (p. 15) that is shared by all tracks 1–5. 
When recording ends, the original tempo is automatically calculated according to the following conditions.
* RC-505 does not display the value of the Original Tempo. 
Condition

Rhythm is playing
Original tempo will be set from the “phrase memory tempo” (p. 15).
Other tracks contain phrases for which 
One-Shot is OFF and Loop Sync is also 
ON.
Cases other than the above
The original tempo is automatically calculated according to the following conditions.
Phrase Memory Tempo will be set to the same value as the automatically calculated original tempo.
The track’s number of 
measures (Measure; p. 13) has 
been specified
The original tempo is calculated according to the rhythm’s time signature (Beat; p. 19) and the number of 
measures (Measure).
4 measures
2 measures
4/4 time signature
4/4 time signature
For example, if the time signature (Beat) is “4/4,” the number of measures (Measure) is “4,” and 
you’ve recorded for six seconds, the calculated tempo will be “160.”
If the number of measures (Measure) is set to “2,” the calculated tempo will be “80.”
The track’s number of 
measures (Measure; p. 13) is 
not specified (AUTO/FREE)
The recorded number of measures is assumed to be “1, 2, 4, 8, 16... measures,” and the original tempo 
will be calculated in the range of “80–160.”
For example, if “4/4” is specified as the time signature (Beat), and you record for eight seconds, the 
calculated tempo will be “120” (a tempo in the range of “80–160” will be selected).

* Never perform the following actions until you have 
disconnected the USB drive. Doing so might make your 
computer freeze, or might result in the loss of all of the RC-505’s 
data.
• Disconnect the USB cable.
• Allow your computer to enter suspend (standby) or 
hibernate mode, restart it, or shut it down.
• Turn off the RC-505’s power.
* Unfortunately, it may be impossible to restore the contents of 
data that was stored in the unit’s memory once it has been lost. 
Roland Corporation assumes no liability concerning such loss of 
data.
About the original tempo of WAV files imported from a computer
•  The original tempo (p. 14) and the number of measures in the track (Measure; p. 13) of an imported WAV file are specified by calculation based on the 
selected rhythm’s time signature (Beat; p. 19).
•  If you’re importing a WAV file that has a time signature other 
than 4/4, you should first specify the rhythm’s time signature 
(Beat; p. 19) for that phrase memory and then save the phrase 
memory before importing the file.
•  The RC-505 will assume that you’ve recorded “1, 2, 4, 8, 16... 
measures,” and will calculate the tempo within the range of 
“80–160.” 
This means that when you import a WAV file from your 
computer, the original tempo might be specified as double or 
half the true tempo. In this case, you can change the original 
tempo to the correct value by specifying the number of 
measures (Measure; p. 13).
In the case of 4 measures…Tempo: 140
In the case of 2 measures…Tempo: 70
When you import a WAV file with “tempo: 70 (number of measures: 2)” from 
your computer, “140” will be set as the original tempo (in order to keep the 
tempo within the range of 80–160).
In the case of 8 measures…Tempo: 280
In this case, you can correct the original tempo to “70” by changing the 
number of measures (Measure; p. 13) from “4” to “2.”

Connecting an External MIDI Device
What is MIDI?
MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a standard specification that allows musical data to be transferred between electronic musical 
instruments and computers. If a MIDI cable is connected between devices equipped with MIDI connectors, you’ll be able to play multiple 
devices from a single MIDI keyboard, perform ensembles using multiple MIDI instruments, program the settings to change automatically as 
the song progresses, and more.
About MIDI Connectors
The following types of connector are used to convey MIDI messages. MIDI cables are connected to these connectors as needed.
Connector
Explanation
MIDI IN
Receives messages from another MIDI device.
MIDI OUT
Transmits messages from this device.
MEMO
You can also use a USB cable to connect the USB port to your computer, and use USB MIDI to transfer MIDI data between the RC-505 and your 
computer. For details, refer to “Connecting to Your Computer via USB” (p. 26) and “Setting the USB Mode (USB Mode)” (p. 24).
MIDI settings
For details on the RC-505’s various MIDI parameters, refer to “MIDI-Related Settings” (p. 25).
* Use of MIDI requires that the MIDI channels be matched with those of the connected device. Data cannot be transmitted to, nor received from 
another MIDI device unless the MIDI channels are set properly.

Operation
Over View
Explanation
Transmitting Tempo 
Data and Data for 
Starting and Stopping 
Playback
The RC-505’s performance tempo data is 
transmitted to external MIDI devices as MIDI 
clock.
Setting an external MIDI device to the same tempo as the RC-505
MIDI clock messages are output from the RC-505 at all times. Set the external MIDI device 
beforehand so it is ready to receive MIDI Clock and MIDI Start and Stop messages. For details, 
refer to the owner’s manual that came with the device.
Playback start and stop operations with the 
RC-505’s buttons can be transmitted as MIDI 
Start and Stop messages.
Transmitting Start/Stop
A MIDI Start message is transmitted at the moment that recording or playback of the track 
begins, when tracks had been stopped. This message is also transmitted when an All Start is 
carried out.
A MIDI Stop message is transmitted when tracks have stopped. This is also transmitted when All 
Stop is in carried out.
* Tracks whose One-Shot setting (p. 12) is “ON” and tracks whose Loop Sync setting (p. 13) is “OFF” 
will not transmit start/stop data.
Transmitting Program 
Change Messages
When a phrase memory is selected with the 
RC-505, a Program Change message cor-
responding to the selected phrase memory 
number is transmitted simultaneously.
Transmitting Program Changes
When phrase memories are switched on the RC-505, a MIDI Program Change message is 
transmitted to the connected external MIDI device. You can transmit Program Change messages 
numbered 1 through 99,corresponding to the 99 individual phrase memories 1–99.
* Set “MIDI Program Change Out” (p. 25) to ON beforehand.
* Program Change messages 100–128 cannot be transmitted.
* Bank Select MIDI messages (Control Change #0, #32) cannot be transmitted.
Transmitting Control 
Change Messages
Operations you perform using the FX knobs, 
or an external expression pedal or external 
footswitch can be output in the form of 
data called Control Change messages. These 
messages can be used for various purposes, 
such as controlling the parameters of an 
external MIDI device.
Transmit a control change
By selecting a control change as the Assign Target (p. 17), you can use the RC-505’s FX knobs, 
or an external expression pedal or external footswitch (connected to the CTL 1, 2/EXP jack) to 
transmit MIDI control change messages.

the nearest Roland Service Center, or an 
authorized Roland distributor, as listed on the “Information” 
page.
Do not use or store in the following types of 
locations
• Subject to temperature extremes (e.g., 
direct sunlight in an enclosed vehicle, 
near a heating duct, on top of heat-
generating equipment); or are
• Damp (e.g., baths, washrooms, on wet 
floors); or are
• Exposed to steam or smoke; or are
• Subject to salt exposure; or are
• Humid; or are
• Exposed to rain; or are
• Dusty or sandy; or are
• Subject to high levels of vibration and shakiness.
Do not place in an unstable location
Make sure you always have the unit placed 
so it is level and sure to remain stable. Never 
place it on stands that could wobble, or on 
inclined surfaces.
Use only the supplied AC adaptor and the correct 
voltage
Be sure to use only the AC adaptor supplied 
with the unit. Also, make sure the line voltage 
at the installation matches the input voltage 
specified on the AC adaptor’s body. Other AC 
adaptors may use a different polarity, or be 
designed for a different voltage, so their use could result in 
damage, malfunction, or electric shock.
Do not bend the power cord or place heavy objects on it
Do not excessively twist or bend the power 
cord, nor place heavy objects on it. Doing 
so can damage the cord, producing severed 
elements and short circuits. Damaged cords 
are fire and shock hazards!
 WARNING

AC adaptor and clean it by using a dry cloth 
to wipe all dust and other accumulations 
away from its prongs. Also, disconnect the 
power plug from the power outlet whenever 
the unit is to remain unused for an extended period of time. 
Any accumulation of dust between the power plug and the 
power outlet can result in poor insulation and lead to fire.
Manage cables for safety
Try to prevent cords and cables from 
becoming entangled. Also, all cords and 
cables should be placed so they are out of 
the reach of children.

IMPORTANT NOTES
Power Supply
• Do not connect this unit to same electrical outlet 
that is being used by an electrical appliance that 
is controlled by an inverter or a motor (such as a 
refrigerator, washing machine, microwave oven, or 
air conditioner). Depending on the way in which 
the electrical appliance is used, power supply noise 
may cause this unit to malfunction or may produce 
audible noise. If it is not practical to use a separate 
electrical outlet, connect a power supply noise filter 
between this unit and the electrical outlet.
• The AC adaptor will begin to generate heat after long 
hours of consecutive use. This is normal, and is not a 
cause for concern.
• To prevent malfunction and equipment failure, 
always make sure to turn off the power on all your 
equipment before you make any connections.
Placement
• Using the unit near power amplifiers (or other 
equipment containing large power transformers) 
may induce hum. To alleviate the problem, change 
the orientation of this unit; or move it farther away 
from the source of interference.
• This device may interfere with radio and television 
reception. Do not use this device in the vicinity of 
such receivers.
• Noise may be produced if wireless communications 
devices, such as cell phones, are operated in the 
vicinity of this unit. Such noise could occur when 
receiving or initiating a call, or while conversing. 
Should you experience such problems, you should 
relocate such wireless devices so they are at a greater 
distance from this unit, or switch them off.
• Do not expose the unit to direct sunlight, place 
it near devices that radiate heat, leave it inside 
an enclosed vehicle, or otherwise subject it to 
temperature extremes. Excessive heat can deform or 
discolor the unit.
• When moved from one location to another where 
the temperature and/or humidity is very different, 
water droplets (condensation) may form inside 
the unit. Damage or malfunction may result if you 
attempt to use the unit in this condition. Therefore, 
before using the unit, you must allow it to stand for 
several hours, until the condensation has completely 
evaporated.
• Depending on the material and temperature of the 
surface on which you place the unit, its rubber feet 
may discolor or mar the surface. 
You can place a piece of felt or cloth under the 
rubber feet to prevent this from happening. If you 
do so, please make sure that the unit will not slip or 
move accidentally.
• Do not place containers or anything else containing 
liquid on top of this unit. Also, whenever any liquid 
has been spilled on the surface of this unit, be sure to 
promptly wipe it away using a soft, dry cloth.
Maintenance
• For everyday cleaning wipe the unit with a soft, 
dry cloth or one that has been slightly dampened 
with water. To remove stubborn dirt, use a cloth 
impregnated with a mild, non-abrasive detergent. 
Afterwards, be sure to wipe the unit thoroughly with 
a soft, dry cloth.
• Never use benzine, thinners, alcohol or solvents of 
any kind, to avoid the possibility of discoloration 
and/or deformation.
Repairs and Data
• Before sending the unit away for repairs, be sure to 
make a backup of the data stored within it; or you 
may prefer to write down the needed information. 
Although we will do our utmost to preserve the 
data stored in your unit when we carry out repairs, 
in some cases, such as when the memory section 
is physically damaged, restoration of the stored 
content may be impossible. Roland assumes no 
liability concerning the restoration of any stored 
content that has been lost.
Additional Precautions
• Any data stored within the unit can be lost as the 
result of equipment failure, incorrect operation, etc. 
To protect yourself against the irretrievable loss of 
data, try to make a habit of creating regular backups 
of the data you’ve stored in the unit.
• Roland assumes no liability concerning the 
restoration of any stored content that has been lost.
• Use a reasonable amount of care when using the 
unit’s buttons, sliders, or other controls; and when 
using its jacks and connectors. Rough handling can 
lead to malfunctions.
• Never strike or apply strong pressure to the display.
• When disconnecting all cables, grasp the connector 
itself—never pull on the cable. This way you will 
avoid causing shorts, or damage to the cable’s 
internal elements.
• To avoid disturbing others nearby, try to keep the 
unit’s volume at reasonable levels.
• When you need to transport the unit, package it 
in the box (including padding) that it came in, if 
possible. Otherwise, you will need to use equivalent 
packaging materials.
• Use only the specified expression pedal (Roland 
EV-5, etc. ; sold separately). By connecting any other 
expression pedals, you risk causing malfunction and/
or damage to the unit.
• Some connection cables contain resistors. Do not use 
cables that incorporate resistors for connecting to 
this unit. The use of such cables can cause the sound 
level to be extremely low, or impossible to hear. For 
information on cable specifications, contact the 
manufacturer of the cable.
• The explanations in this manual include illustrations 
that depict what should typically be shown by 
the display. Note, however, that your unit may 
incorporate a newer, enhanced version of the system 
(e.g., includes newer sounds), so what you actually 
see in the display may not always match what 
appears in the manual.
